# Work Anywhere

Work Anywhere is a freelancer platform that allows anyone to accept a job, create a job, and build credit via earned trust and wages. Reputation (trust score) is composable across the WorldChain network, allowing users to build and use trust--for example, in taking out uncollateralized loans.

## World Tools

Users verify their personhood with Orbs and generate a unique World ID and corresponding wallet. We support World ID sign in and World wallet connection, which allows users to pay and receive other users for complete jobs.

We support staking for earned WLD tokens so users can earn WLD and collectively stake to earn yield via the platform. This allows users to earn passive income.

We benefit immensely from a seamless blockchain purpose built for Worldcoin users and built in account abstraction infrastructure, which makes the user experience immensely easy to send and receive money.

### LLM for Platform Wide Learning 

We implemented a multi-faceted approach that combined fine-tuning a model with domain-specific tasks (eg location based moving, childcare, housework etc) that is commoon to the platform and integrated this with our support workflows. This allows the platform to learn iteratively from user interactions and errors. LLM was trained on historical customer support tickets, internal FAQs, and Worldcoin / internal platform documentation. Users interact via chatbots and live agent tools so that repetitive queries are handled via agents.
